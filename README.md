## About this app
This is a Bitcoin price ticker. The app will give you the latest Bitcoin prices in all the popular, traded currencies, so you can track how well your Bitcoin investments are doing on the go.
##### In this app I use:
* UIKit/programmatically layout.
* Dark Mode.
* Apple's SF Symbols.
* UIPickerView.
* Protocols and delegates. Delegate pattern.
* Extensions.
* Networking with URL session and HTTP requests.
* Parsing JSON data with the native Encodable and Decodable protocols.
